# FirebaseAuthentications
Shows the completed Sign In and Registration Process using Firebase Authentications
The following screenshot shows how our app looks like.

It's a basic Login and Registration App which uses firestore to store username and password. And it uses the authentication process of firebase in the form of USERID which is a separate variable that stores different ID for different Username. Once the userID that you provide and the userID that the firestore has got matched then, the authentications process the request and navigate you the users to the Dashboard screen.
